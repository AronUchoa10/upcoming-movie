# Upcoming Movies
This is a simple project to show a list of upcoming movies, details of movies and search by movies. I used the Movie Data Base
API 3 to return the informations for the app. The code was implemented in Kotlin and was used Android Studio version 3.2 Canary 2
## Libraries and frameworks used on the sample project
AppCompat, CardView an DesignLibrary  
Retrofit 2 and Gson  
Glide  

I used Retrofit to REST services, Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.  
Gson to serialize my object models.  
CardView to build a nice container to show the detail data of movies.  
And Glide framework to load url images.
